Crusaders
=========

Skill based RTS featuring a supersex java graphics2d engine.

Supposed to be similar to DOTa (I've never actually played the game) where a player has a single character they control, but based mainly on the player's ability to maneuver their character around the environment and against other players. (Kind of like a fighting/RTS game).
